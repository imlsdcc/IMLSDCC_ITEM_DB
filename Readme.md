This repository contains all of the SQL stored procedures to create an item repository data base the conforms to the IMLS Digital Collections & Content item repository database. Also included are a series of vbscript files for ingesting xml data files into the resulting database and xsl files to augment base xml files into metadata files that better conform to the IMLS DCC data model and facilitate indexing and IR functionality. This code assumes a MS SQL Server 2012 running environment and will need adjustments for other database environments. For best results, it is assumed that a collection registry database conforming to the IMLS DCC collections data model will be running in parallel. Much of the indexing relies on the relationships between the collections and the items.
