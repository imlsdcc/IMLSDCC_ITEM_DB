        The following facetTerms are based on spreadsheet created by Sarah Shreeves 
        after her analysis of metadata in the transportation database, based on LTGM i think
        Her spreadsheet also has DCMI types, which i think are already being incorporated during
        standard.expand phase of processing, though i'm not sure how well...-->
    
    <!-- NOTE: The following type elements have an important order: more specific terms should come first, 
        parent terms after; this is to add the most specific facet term possible to the record, because the stylesheet
        proceeds in order through this list seeking a match term and stops when a match is found -->
